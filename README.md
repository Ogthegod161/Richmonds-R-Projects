This project examines how standardized test scores and application volume influence university admission rates using statistical analysis and machine learning. The analysis involved cleaning and preparing the data, exploring key trends through visualisation and correlation analysis, and building multiple predictive models.
Several regression models—including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Regression—were developed and evaluated using MAE and RMSE to compare performance. The results demonstrate the predictive value of SAT/ACT scores and application numbers, while showcasing an end-to-end analytical workflow from data preparation to model evaluation and insight generation.
